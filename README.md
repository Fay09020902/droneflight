### `How to start`
After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up the application. First, in project frontend folder,  where youâ€™ll run npm install to install all necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, activate the virtual environment in project folder using pipenv shell, then start the Flask server with 'pipenv run flask run'. In a separate terminal,go into the frontend direction react-dom and then run 'npm start'. This should open your browser automatically but if not, you may navigate to localhost:3000 to access the application. If any environment variables are required (such as API keys), make sure they are configured locally in .env files for both the backend and frontend as specified in the setup instructions. These steps should allow you to run the application seamlessly.
pipenv install python-dotenv
